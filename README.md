# MARK\* Benchmark tests

Benchmark tests for the MARK\* protein design algorithm.
This repo contains design files that each specify a single protein design for binding affinity problem instance, along with test result files that describe algorithm performance on design problems.

These design problems were procedurally generated using PyMOL and (currently) unreleased tools.

## Usage

Install OSPREY and the python TOML module.
OSPREY ConfSpace objects can be generated from design files using methods in `tools.py`, after which designs can be run normally.

##Repository structure

* `tools.py`

	A python module with methods for loading design files and computing energy matrices.
	Requires the latest version of [OSPREY](https://github.com/donaldlab/OSPREY3) and the [TOML python module](https://pypi.org/project/toml/).
* `bin/`

	Contains example scripts for running MARK\* on design problems.
* `designs/`
	* `disc_binding_ms/`

		Contains multi-sequence designs for binding affinity, intended for a discrete formulation.
	* `disc_binding_ss/`

		Contains single-sequence designs for binding affinity, intended for a discrete formulation.
* `tests/`
	* `1810_disc_binding_ss_mark/`

		Contains test results generated by running the MARK\* algorithm with BBK\* on discrete problems previously reported in [the MARK\* paper](https://doi.org/10.1089/cmb.2019.0315).
		These tests were run on single-sequence design problems.
		Runtimes reflect the time required to compute the K\* score for the specified sequence.
	* `1810_disc_binding_ss_mark/`

		Contains test results generated by running the iMinDEE/A\*/K\* algorithm with BBK\* on discrete problems previously reported in [the MARK\* paper](https://doi.org/10.1089/cmb.2019.0315).
		These tests were run on single-sequence design problems.
		Runtimes reflect the time required to compute the K\* score for the specified sequence.
